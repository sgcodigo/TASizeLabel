## Configuration

Since this label component is based on **Stylesheet**, you may need to get the stylesheet first with variable font sizes.



There are two way to use this l

**1. Variables Defination (`let` and `var`)**

- Please name the variable and constant as simple as possible and make it easy to understand. And please use `_`,`-`,`&`,`$` as **low** as possible.

- All the variables first word should start with lowercased. And the next further words can start with capitalized.

      var thisIsNewVariable = 123456

- Dont use `_`**(underscore)** on start of the variable naming.
